## Project Proposal
For WTWY I plan on exploring the MTA turnstile data to discover the highest foot traffic locations in order to place street teams so that they may have the highest chance of gathering emails of potential gala attendees. By doing so, the goal is to increase membership and gala attendance as well as increase their outreach and awareness of women and their participation in technological sectors.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Data Used

I will be examining 3 months of MTA turnstile data that is publicly available in order to fulfill this goal, primarily looking at the highest traffic stations, days of the week, and times. This data consists of the month of June 2021 through the month of August 2021. The **MVP** would be a jupyter notebook containing a bar chart showing which station had the most foot traffic on average throughout the time span given, providing a very simple form of where the highest chances of getting potential email signatures and potential gala attendees.
