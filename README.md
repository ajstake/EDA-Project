# Exploratory Analysis of MTA Turnstile Data

The goal of WTWY and this exploratory data analysis is to increase the overall number of contact points for survey teams to increase the number of email signatures gathered, gala attendance, and overall outreach. This is achieved through looking at MTA turnstile data to gather the number of daily exits at each station over three months of data from 2021. The recommended stations and day for WTWY to post their teams are Grand Central Station and 42nd St, 34th St and Herald Square, 42nd St and Port Authority, 34th and Penn Station, and Flushing and Main all on Thursdays as these are the stations and the day with the highest overall traffic.
