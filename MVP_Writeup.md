# Early Findings

The earliest findings show that the two stations that see the most traffic are 34th St and Penn and 34th and Herald Square. Based on the data in figure 1, the 3rd and 4th most trafficked stations are 14th and Union Square and Grand Central Station at 42nd St. Given this information, there would be a distinct increase in contact points if WTWY puts their teams at these five stations they are more likely to have more contact points and therefore more likely to get email signatures. Fulton St is also shown to have a high number of entries with few exits, so it would also be a good location to place a team to gather signatures.
