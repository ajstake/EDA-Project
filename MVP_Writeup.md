# Early Findings

The earliest findings show that the five stations with the highest overall entry traffic are 34th and Herald Square, Grand Central Station at 42nd St, the New World Trade Center station, 34th and Penn St, and the 42nd St Port Authority. Given this information, placing teams at these 5 stations would increase their overall contact points and would likely increase the number of email signatures gathered, subsequently increasing gala attendance.
